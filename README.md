Age and Emotion Detection through voice:
Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to detect a person’s age from a voice note.
The model should only process male voices; if a female voice is detected, it should reject the input and display a message saying, “Upload male voice.”
If the person’s age is more than 60, the model should mark them as a senior citizen and detect their emotion. For individuals below 60, the model should only detect their age.
